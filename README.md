# INST126-Project-3
## Michael Pulley
### For Project 3, we are given the task to analyze a log file which contains various forms of information about 50 different users, and with this information we are to generate automated reports. The log file consists of rows and columns of information about the users. The first column in each row represents the "Date and Time" of the activity, in which is separated by a space. The second column of each row represents the "User Activity", which includes "login" and "logout". The third column of every row represents the "Server" from which the activity of the user has occurred. The user activities correlate with 3 different system servers, including "mailserver.local", "myworkstation.local", and "webserver.local". The fourth and final column gives the specific Email-ID of the user. There are 4 different reports that we have to generate from the information provided by the log file. The first report that we have to generate is a "Suspicious Activities" report (suspicious_report.txt). For this report, we have to record if any user logs into any of the systems more than 5 times in a single day, or if the user logs into any of the systems between 12:00 am to 5:00 am. If any user does any of these, it will be marked as suspicious behavior. The second report that we have to generate is an "Irresponsible Behaviors" report (irresponsible_report.txt). In this report, we are given the task to check if the number of logins is greater than the number of logouts for a certain user on a given day. If the number of logins is greater than the number of logouts, it can be marked as an irresponsible activity. The third report that we need to generate is a "System Glitch" report (glitch_report.txt). For this report, we have to record the opposite of the "Irresponsible Behaviors" report tasks. That is, if the system records a greater number of logouts than the number of logins for any user, we mark it as a system glitch. The fourth and final report that we are required to generate is a "Domain Count" report. In this report, we are to generate a list of all the unique domains, as well as the number of users registered within each domain.
### For each report, we were to create a flowchart that describes the process and analysis of how to solve the given problems. These flowcharts give us a visual representation as to how our code should be written and programmed. The flowcharts being created for each report will specifically assist the user through the process of the code, so that they can see how it works and what functions, operators, iterations, etc. work together.
